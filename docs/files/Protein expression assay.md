Sample normalization for un-induced/induced E. coli expression sample

<br />Take a sample before induction and in the morning before harvesting the cells after expression.
Note: For the after expression the OD600, will be quite high (4-6), perform 10 times dilution in LB media for the OD600 measurement.
<br />
<br />0,5/OD600 = X ml required culture.
<br />Example if the OD600 = 0,8 then 0,5/0,8 = 0,625 mL.
<br />1. Spin down calculated amount of cells for 2 mins at 13000 rpm and remove the media.
<br />2. Re-suspend the cells in 40μl dH2O and add 10μl 5xSDS Loading Buffer.
<br />3. Heat the sample for 10 mins at 95°C, and spin down for 1 min at 13000 rpm.
<br />4. Load 5 μl on a 10 well gel.
<br />4. Run SDS-PAGE using standard protocol
