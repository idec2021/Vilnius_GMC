<br />**DNA electrophoresis**
<br />
<br />Protein samples were mixed with 4X SDS-PAGE dye, heated in 90-100 °C water bath for 5 minutes. Protein electrophoresis was performed in 12% fractionating gel using classic Laemmli method. Gels after electrophoresis were washed with 90-100 °C water for 10 minutes and stained with Thermo Scientific™ PageBlue™ Protein Staining Solution overnight. Gels were destained in 90-100 °C water.
