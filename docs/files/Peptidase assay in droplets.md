Emulsion was generated in a PDMS chip prepared using standardised protocol using Harvard Apparatus syringe pumps in a simple droplet maker device using HFE-7500 oil from Novetec supplemented with 1.5% EA surfactant from RAN Biotechnologies. Flow rates were 300 µL/h for the oil phase and 100 µL/h for the water phase. The emulsion was collected in an Eppendorf 1.5 mL DNA low binding tube containing mineral oil to prevent evaporation. Droplets were incubated overnight at 37 °C.
