Homologs of target protein were found using BLAST (expect threshold = 0.05, Word size = 3, Matrix = BLOSUM62, Gap Costs = Existence: 11 Extension: 1, Compositional adjustments  = Conditional compositional score matrix adjustment) and proteins with >95% sequence identity were selected. Multiple sequence alignments were created by MAFFT algorithm using default parameters (matrix = blosum62, gap open penalty = 1.53, gap extension penalty = 0.123, order = aligned, tree rebuilding number = 2, guide tree output = on, maxiterate = 2, perform ffts = none). Multiple sequence alignment was visualised using Jalview.
