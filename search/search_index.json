With our project, we aim to perform rounds of directed evolution on the autolysin SagA to make it suitable to act as an endolysin against the well-known pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. Using the aid of the powerful tool of droplet microfluidic, libraries of SagA will be screened for increased activity against a model fluorogenic peptide, and the final product of evolution will be then used to perform in vivo assays to assess the new activity.","title":"Home"},{"location":"team/","text":"Our Team We are Jonas and Lorenzo.

A terrifying and often mythicized example is the bubonic plague that devastated Europe and Asia in the mid 1300s; only in the age of modern genetics it was found that the disease is caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis ' infection (Demeure et al, 2019). Y. pestis is only one of tens of bacterial species pathogenic to humans. With the discovery of penicillin, the golden age of antibiotics began (Chain et al., 2005) and in 1945 penicillin was already mass-produced. From 1950s to the '70s, most of the antibiotic classes today known were discovered (Zaman et al., 2017). During this time antibiotics were regarded as the perfect answer to bacterial infections: they were safe and effective. However, the unregulated use of antibiotics eventually led to the emergence of resistant bacterial strains (Fig 1.) (Aminov, 2010). The level of antibiotic-resistant infections was found to be strongly correlated with the degree of antibiotic consumption (Goossens et al., 2005). Bacteria develop antibiotic resistance using various mechanisms: hydrolysis, efflux, altered target, chemical modification (Zaman et al., 2017). United States\u2019 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that in the US more than 35000 people die each year of antibiotic resistant infections, and the estimated cost of treatment of multi-drug resistant pathogens in US is estimated $4.6 billion (Nelson et al., 2021). As fewer new antibiotics are commercialised and multidrug resistance develops, new antibacterial agents are necessary. Figure 1. Graphical representation of discovery of antibiotic versus time to discover antibiotic resistance. The red arrow (lower direction) indicates the discovery void and increased antibiotic resistance (Adapted from Zaman et al., 2017). Resistance Wars: A New Hope As fewer new antibiotics are commercialised and multidrug resistance develops, new antibacterial agents are necessary. As conventional antibiotics proved to be unreliable, attention was drawn to bacteriophages and their lytic enzymes, and phage therapy is gaining a second wind in modern medicine. Even though phage therapy is still in it's infancy, trials conducted so far have reported no adverse effects concerning the use of phages, confirming previous observations in mice (Melo et al., 2020). Usage of phages may pose other threat - as bacteria are prone to develop antiviral resistance (Gao Linyi et al., 2020; Koonin et al., 2017). To tackle the problem of bacterial infection, different strategies have to be employed. An alternative to phage therapy is using a phage lytic enzyme that is usually is further engineered. Such enzymes possess bacterial cell wall-degrading activity and are used by phages to escape the cell (V\u00e1zquez et al., 2018). A-(D-iN)-K-(D-A)-(D-A): Just Another Brick In The Wall Peptidoglycan is the main component of bacterial cell wall (Fig 2).; it consists of a sugar backbone chain interlinked by short peptides. While the sugar backbone is universal for all bacteria, its structure and interlinking peptides varies depending on bacteria taxon (Schleifer and Kandler, 1972). Phage lytic enzymes \u2013 endolysins \u2013 targeting PG sugars have been shown to reduce bacteria growth in vitro and in vivo, and their use as antimicrobial agents has advanced to the stage of clinical trials (Abdelkader et al., 2019; Vermassen et al., 2019). Most enzymes under development to this purpose target the sugar backbone of PG, while those targeting PG interlinking peptides have been overlooked (Vermassen et al., 2019). Development of antimicrobial enzymes with endopeptidase activity could broaden the arsenal of know enzymatic antibacterial agents; such peptidase could be developed to target a specific range of bacteria by targeting a specific peptide. In addition, peptidoglycan-associated peptides contain D-amino acids, which are not present in mammalian proteins. Therefore, targeting D-L peptides may contribute to safe use in animals. Large part of phage lysins in nature are modular \u2013 displaying multiple domains with different functions (Vermassen et al., 2019). By combining modules with different enzymatic and peptidoglycan binding activities new desired antibacterial agents can be developed (Gerstmans et al., 2020). Figure 2. Structure of S. aureus peptidoglycan. X-zymes: targets for mutagenesis and evolution Proteins from the NlpC/P60 family were selected as the target for evolution. These proteins, referd as autolysins, participate in cell growth by relaxing peptidoglycan, necessary to allow cell growth and division (Typas et al., 2012), and they usually harbour aditional domains. SagA use coiled coil domain for localization at cell division terminus (Espinosa et al., 2020; Hyun et al., 2021), while three LysM-domain repeats in LytE ensure affinity ro peptidoglycan (Visweswaran et al., 2014). The goal of this project is to evolve only the NlpC/p60 domain either as s stand-alone protein or fused to native peptidoglycan binding domain. The NlpC/P60 domain is a papain-like cysteine peptidase domain approximately 100 amino acids long (Anantharaman and Aravind, 2003). These endopeptidases are involved in the cleavage of the N-acetylmuramate-L-alanine or D-\u03b3-glutamyl-mesodiaminopimelate (Ohnishi et al., 1999). The selection of the NlpC/P60 peptidase family was driven for three main reasons: Potential to be evolved to act as efficient peptidoglycan lysis enzymes; Specificity to peptidoglycan DL-peptides; Small size of NlpC/P60 domain, appealing for use in medicine and biotechnology. We selected two putative autolysins: SagA from Enterococcus faecium and LytE from Bacillus subtilis . We also decided to use the standalone NlpC/P60 domains of SagA and LytE. With our project, we aim to perform evolution on the autolysin to make it suitable to act as an endolysin against S. aureus . Figure 3. A) Alphafold2 model of SagA protein. NlpC/P60 domain is yellow, coiled-coil \u2013 purple. Protein is also rich in unstructured loops, which are colored in grey. B) Alphafold2 model of LytE protein.

These proteins, referd as autolysins, participate in cell growth by relaxing peptidoglycan, necessary to allow cell growth and division (Typas et al., 2012), and they usually harbour aditional domains. SagA use coiled coil domain for localization at cell division terminus (Espinosa et al., 2020; Hyun et al., 2021), while three LysM-domain repeats in LytE ensure affinity ro peptidoglycan (Visweswaran et al., 2014). The goal of this project is to evolve only the NlpC/p60 domain either as s stand-alone protein or fused to native peptidoglycan binding domain. The NlpC/P60 domain is a papain-like cysteine peptidase domain approximately 100 amino acids long (Anantharaman and Aravind, 2003). These endopeptidases are involved in the cleavage of the N-acetylmuramate-L-alanine or D-\u03b3-glutamyl-mesodiaminopimelate (Ohnishi et al., 1999). The selection of the NlpC/P60 peptidase family was driven for three main reasons: Potential to be evolved to act as efficient peptidoglycan lysis enzymes; Specificity to peptidoglycan DL-peptides; Small size of NlpC/P60 domain, appealing for use in medicine and biotechnology. We selected two putative autolysins: SagA from Enterococcus faecium and LytE from Bacillus subtilis . We also decided to use the standalone NlpC/P60 domains of SagA and LytE. With our project, we aim to perform evolution on the autolysin to make it suitable to act as an endolysin against S. aureus . Figure 3. A) Alphafold2 model of SagA protein. NlpC/P60 domain is yellow, coiled-coil \u2013 purple. Protein is also rich in unstructured loops, which are colored in grey. B) Alphafold2 model of LytE protein.

Retro-aldolase 95.2B-3 (RA) was cloned in the same vector as control. Sanger sequencing relvealed that LytE gene underwent a frame-shift mutation, therefore the construct was not used. Genes were expressed in Escherichia coli . And purified over a Ni-NTA column. RA, SagAP60 and LytEP60 were purified with acceptable yield, while full length SagA was not recovered in the eluate(Fig 1). Larger amounts of RA and SagAP60 proteins were purified using \u00c4KTA Avant chromatography system in a second stage (Fig 2). Figure 1. SDS-PAGE analysis of proteins purified using spin-columns. Target proteins are denoted by black arrowheads. Figure 2. SDS-PAGE analysis of of proteins purified using chromatographer. Target proteins are denoted by black arrowheads. Purification was performed after submitting the report. Microtiter plate assay Purified enzyme fractions have been used to test activity in microtiter plate assay. This proof-of-concept experiment shows that an NlpC/P60 domain can cut synthetic peptide generating fluorescent signal over background. Since starting protein activity is low (after a few hours reaction continues) it is a good starting point to test proposed directed evolution method. Figure 3. Microtiter plate assay. Blue \u2013 buffer, cyan \u2013 Retro-aldolase, green \u2013 SagAP60. Endopeptidase assay in droplets Following the test in microtiter plate, an experiment to verify functionality of the enzyme assay in droplets was performed: a solution of assay buffer containing the enzyme (Fig 4A) and a control solution of assay buffer without the enzyme (Fig 4B) were encapsulated and the emulsion was imaged after overnight incubation at 37\u00b0C. To verify the long-term retention of the fluorescent signal in the positive droplets, 10 \u00b5L aliquots from both emulsions were mixed and imaged after incubation at 37\u00b0C for 2 days (Fig 4C). No appreciable fluorescence exchange between positive and negative droplets was detected. Figure 4. Assay in droplet. A \u2013 positive sample after encapsulation (time 0); B \u2013 positive emulsion containing the enzyme (top) next to control emulsion (bottom); C \u2013 mixed emulsion of positive and control sample: no leakage is observed after 2 days incubation. Live assay on cell suspension Purified SagAP60 and RA control were used on a suspension of S. aureus to test the starting antimicrobial activity. The test was carried out as cell growth assay, by observing the increase of OD600 of cells suspended in LB medium (Fig 5). Figure 5. S. aureus growth inhibition assay. Blue \u2013 background (buffer); Cyan \u2013 RA control; Green - SagAP60; Yellow \u2013 cell negative control, without any enzyme added. From the results it appears that the added proteins have a positive effect on growth compared to negative control: we believe this is due to the fact that they were added to the assay as glycerol stocks, providing an additional carbon source we haven\u2019t accounted for, with a 4% glycerol final concentration in the well. For this reason, this test will be repeated using dialysed protein sample. Even though the addition of SagAP60 impacted cell growth negatively (compared to negative control and RA), the difference may be insignificant (Figure 6). It also appears that RA impacts cell growth positively in some unknown mechanism. It is unclear why this is observed. At this point, it is clear that for evaluating lytic activity on live cells an active site mutant control will be needed. Also, it is apparent, that SagAP60 does not lyse S. aureus cell wall efficiently. This is probably explained by the low activity of enzymes which may be increased by directed evolution. Figure 6. S. aureus growth inhibition assay. Blue \u2013 background (buffer); Cyan \u2013 RA control; Green - SagAP60; Yellow \u2013 cell negative control, without any enzyme added. This assay was performed using re-purified proteins after the submission of the report. Discussion These preliminary proof-of-concept experiments confirm the effectiveness of our directed evolution strategy. We verified that the C-terminal NlpC/P60 domain of SagA can digest the FRET D-L-peptide-based molecular beacon and that the absence of the N-terminal domain is not necessary for the protein to display activity. Enzyme activity under the tested conditions is sufficient to generate a fluorescent signal detectable above background in both in microtiter plate and droplet assays. Commonly, the fluorophores present in commercially available fluorogenic substrate are exchanged between the fluorescent positive droplets \u2013 where the reactions occurred \u2013 and the negative ones, posing a relevant technical issue for the sorting step; the cleavage of the peptide beacon releases the fluorophore covalently bonded to 3 amino acids residues, greatly increasing its solubility and favouring the long-term retention in the droplet. This was confirmed by the fluorophore exchange assay. We also carried a preliminary experiment to assess the effect of the native SagA Nlpc/P60 domain as S. aureus antimicrobial agent; however, this first results don\u2019t allow to draw any significant conclusion. Further experiments will be necessary to determine the antimicrobial activity of the starting endolysins by titration using different purified enzyme concentration. Overall, we believe that this project represents an interesting proof of concept for the development of new antimicrobial agents based on the currently underused NlpC/P60 peptidase protein family and for the development of enzymes targeting peptides harbouring non-canonical amino acids.","title":"Results"},{"location":"project/results/#results","text":"","title":"Results"},{"location":"project/results/#cloning-and-purification","text":"Genes were cloned in pKTCTET-0-Kan vector containing a C-terminal 6His-tag (Obexer et al., 2016).

This technology has already been successfully applied to evolve enzyme from several classes (Stucki et al., 2021). Figure 1. Droplets microfluidics principles. The assay To this purpose, we developed a microfluidics assay based on a FRET peptide-based molecular beacon mimicking the PG linking peptide of the well-known pathogen Staphylococcus aureus . When such peptide is cut by the enzyme, the fluorophore and quencher parts of the molecule are separated and fluorescence is no no longer quenched, generating fluorescent signal detecable over background. Figure 2. FRET peptide-based molecular beacon will create fluorescent signal after cleavage of peptidic bond. The peptidase is denoted as \"Pacman\", amino acids in the peptide as blue full circles, fluorophore as star, and quencher as a black full circle. Since SagA was reported to cleave PG fragments with tetra- and penta-peptides, we selected the pentapeptide as the substrate (Ala-D-isoGln-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala). For technical reasons related to the laser system installed in the droplet microfluidics station setup, the fluorophore-quencher pair chosen was FAM-Dabcyl. The synthesis of the final beacon peptide required the addition of and Lysine for attaching FAM at C-terminal; therefore, the final sequence of the peptide is (Dabcyl)-Ala-(D-isoGln)-Lys-(D-Ala)-(D-Ala)-Lys-[(N6)-(5-FAM)]. The mutant library will be created by error-prone PCR, and expressed in E. coli BL21. After expression, the library of E. coli cells will be and co-encapsulated with the fluorogenic substrate and lytic reagents aiming to encapsulate one cell per droplet; this allows mixing of the cells and the reagents only with the formation of the droplets. After encapsulation, the single cells will undergo lysis within the droplet, releasing the enzyme mutant making it available to cleave the substrate. Mutants with higher activity will lead to droplets with higher fluorescence, allowing sorting of the droplets by signal detection. Plasmids from sorted droplets will be retrieved and sequenced and subjected to other directed evolution cycle.
